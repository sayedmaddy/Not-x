## Security Best Practices

To ensure the security of this repository, please follow these best practices:

1. **Use HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS URLs for cloning the repository and for any API requests.
2. **Keep Dependencies Updated**: Regularly check and update your dependencies to the latest versions to mitigate vulnerabilities.
3. **Environment Variables**: Store sensitive data such as API keys and passwords in environment variables, rather than hardcoding them in your code.
4. **Code Reviews**: Implement a code review process to ensure that all changes to the codebase are scrutinized for potential security issues.
5. **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user input to prevent attacks such as SQL injection and XSS (Cross-Site Scripting).
6. **Use Security Headers**: Implement security headers like Content Security Policy (CSP), X-Content-Type-Options, and X-Frame-Options to protect your application from certain types of attacks.
7. **Logging and Monitoring**: Implement logging and monitoring to detect any suspicious activity in your application.
8. **Regular Backups**: Ensure that regular backups of your data are taken to recover in case of data loss or corruption.
